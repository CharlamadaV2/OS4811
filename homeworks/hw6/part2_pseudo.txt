Parent process runs containing its own virtual address space mapped to physical pages using page tables
Fork call creates the child process
On child creation, both child and parent page tables will initially point to the same pages in physical memory
All the pages that the both processes share is marked as read only with a COW flag
if the child or parent wants to write to the pages, the COW flag is triggered
When triggered a the kernel allocates a new, free physical page from the system's page pool.
Contents from the original page is copied over to the new page
The process that triggered the flag will now map its virtual address to the new private page.
Then the process that wanted to write to the page will write on the copy
When the child process is done running it will free all of the Child's page table entries
This means that any private pages allocated to the child from COW will be marked unused and returned to the free pool
