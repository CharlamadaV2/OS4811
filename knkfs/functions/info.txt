SPI Notes:
When chip select is set to low the slave is enabled; setting high will disable
At each clock transition from low to high; the devices can transmit data to one another

The EEPROM we are using has two device modes
CPOL = 0, CPHA = 0
CPOL = 1, CPHA = 1
Input is latched for rising edge
Data is output on falling edge
    
In Unix the philosophy is that everything is a file. Therefore my EEPROM is a file, 
therefore my EEPROM has a filepath given this truth.

Inorder for my Raspberry Pi 5 to use SPI I need to enable it in raspi-config.
